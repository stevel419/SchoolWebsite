                Kigurunyembe Secondary School, located in Morogoro, owned by the Catholic Diocese of Morogoro, 
                Tanzania, traces its roots back to 1974. The inception of the school was inspired by the late 
                Fr. J. Franken, who at the time was the Principal of Kigurunyembe Teachers College, currently known 
                as Morogoro Teachers College, Fr Norbert Mpande who is currently working at the Cathedral.
                </p>
                <p>
                Fr. Franken's vision was to provide quality secondary education to the youth of Morogoro 
                and its surrounding regions. His dedication to education and community development laid the 
                foundation for what would become a significant educational institution in the area. The school 
                initiated advanced level wing in 1984, with four combinations of HGE, HGL, HKL and EGM.
